# Attendance
Attendance parser for my mother's biometric scanner.

## How to run
1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Save your attendance file as attendance.txt
3. `python3 attendance.py`
4. See attendance data on localhost:5000 on your browser.

## TODO

1. [] Better UX
2. [] Ease of setup (should not need flask server, should be selfhostable with ease, etc.)
3. [] Easier workflows (email support, file upload?)
4. [] Code cleanup
